# How to Install Dynamic Bone v1.1.7 for Free
 
Dynamic Bone is a popular Unity asset that allows you to apply physics to your character's bones or joints. With a simple setup, you can make your character's hair, cloth, breasts or any part move realistically. However, Dynamic Bone is a paid asset that costs $20 on the Unity Asset Store. If you want to try it out for free, you can follow these steps:

## Examples of Dynamic Bone
 
Dynamic Bone can be used for various purposes, such as creating realistic hair, cloth, tails, ears, wings, breasts and more. Here are some examples of Dynamic Bone in action:

- [Dynamic Bone - Hair and Cloth Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fQ6y9X1X8k): This video shows how Dynamic Bone can be used to create realistic hair and cloth physics for your characters.
- [Dynamic Bone - Animal Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lL7V4ZgY0M): This video shows how Dynamic Bone can be used to create realistic animal physics for your characters, such as tails, ears and wings.
- [Dynamic Bone - Breast Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8uZ7wNnq3o): This video shows how Dynamic Bone can be used to create realistic breast physics for your characters.

These are just some examples of what you can do with Dynamic Bone. You can experiment with different settings and combinations to achieve the desired effect for your characters.

## Optimizing Dynamic Bone for Performance
 
Dynamic Bone is a powerful asset that can create realistic physics for your characters, but it can also affect the performance of your game if not used properly. Here are some tips on how to optimize Dynamic Bone for performance:

- Use fewer bones or joints for Dynamic Bone. The more bones or joints you have, the more calculations Dynamic Bone has to do. Try to use only the essential bones or joints for your character's parts.
- Reduce the update rate of Dynamic Bone. By default, Dynamic Bone updates every frame, which can be costly for performance. You can reduce the update rate by changing the Update Mode and Update Rate fields of the Dynamic Bone component. For example, you can set the Update Mode to Normal and the Update Rate to 0.1, which means Dynamic Bone will update every 10 frames.
- Disable Dynamic Bone when not needed. If your character is not visible or not moving, you can disable Dynamic Bone to save performance. You can use scripts or events to enable or disable Dynamic Bone when needed.

By following these tips, you can optimize Dynamic Bone for performance and make your game run smoother.
